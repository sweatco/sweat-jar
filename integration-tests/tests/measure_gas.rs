//! Lightweight gas-measurement tests.
//!
//! These are `#[ignore]`d so a plain `cargo test`/CI run skips them; run them
//! explicitly via `make measure-gas`. Their printed TGas figures are what
//! `contract/src/feature/claim/api.rs`'s `INITIAL_GAS_FOR_AFTER_CLAIM` /
//! `ADDITIONAL_AFTER_CLAIM_JAR_COST` and `contract/src/feature/withdraw/api.rs`'s
//! `GAS_FOR_AFTER_WITHDRAW` / `GAS_FOR_BULK_AFTER_WITHDRAW` are tuned from —
//! re-run after touching the `after_claim`/`after_withdraw` callback logic and
//! re-check those constants still leave enough headroom.
