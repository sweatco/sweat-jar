## üîé Project Overview

The DeFi Jars contract allows users to stake their NEP-141 fungible tokens and accrue interest from them. It is primarily designed to work with $SWEAT, but in general, it can be configured to work with any NEP-141 FT.

The contract enables a contract administrator to register Products describing the terms of deposits. Users can then stake FTs into Jars, which are deposits based on the specified Products. The contract also provides the ability to restrict the creation of Jars for specific Products based on external conditions and involves third-party services.

## üìñ Terminology

The contract operates with the following entities:

- **Earnings Rate (ER):** This represents the rate, updated per minute, at which a user earns interest on their staked $SWEAT.
- **Product:** A Product defines a set of rules and terms for deposits (Jars).
- **Fixed Product:** A Product with a lockup period into which users can stake $SWEAT. Once the lockup period has matured, the staked amount becomes available for re-staking (with the same ER and period) or for unstaking (withdrawn into the user‚Äôs liquid balance). However, the user stops earning $SWEAT (ER) until it is re-staked.
- **Flexible Product:** A Product with no lockup period.
- **Premium Product:** A Product that has both default and fallback APY rates. A related Jar yields interest based on the default APY rate. However, if a user violates the terms of the Product, a penalty is applied, and the APY downgrades to the fallback value. Both Fixed and Flexible Products can be Premium.
- **Growth Jar:** This is a deposit that follows the terms of a Product. It includes the principal amount and earned interest.
- **Fixed Jar:** A Jar that follows the rules of a Fixed Product.
- **Flexible Jar:** A Jar that follows the rules of a Flexible Product.
- **Premium Jar:** A Jar that follows the rules of a Premium Product.
- **Token Contract:** A NEP-141 Fungible Token contract set upon the deployment of the DeFi Jars contract. The DeFi Jars contract interacts with this FT.

The contract allows users to perform the following actions:

- **Grow:** This term is used when referring to earning $SWEAT by depositing it into a Growth Jar.
- **Stake:** This is the act of sending funds to the contract under specific terms defined by the chosen Product.
- **Unstake:** This is the act of requesting the smart contract to release the exact amount of staked funds back to the original staker's address.
- **Restake:** This refers to the act of re-enacting a previous ‚Äústake‚Äù action under the same terms.
- **Claim:** This is the act of a user requesting the smart contract to release the accrued earnings from applied ERs on all or selected Jars containing funds.

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1. üë§ Roles

The DeFi Jars contract defines three roles:

- **Admin:** The Admin role manages Products. It can register new Products, enable or disable existing Products, and change verifying (public) keys.
- **User:** Users can create Jars by staking tokens, claim accrued interest, unstake their funds, and restake mature Jars.
- **Oracle:** While not directly represented in the contract, the Oracle role can issue signatures to restrict Users' access to specific Products based on conditions that cannot be evaluated within the contract itself.

### 1.2. ‚öôÔ∏è Features

The DeFi Jars contract provides the following features:

- Register a new Product (Admin).
- Enable or disable an existing Product (Admin).
- Change the verifying (public) key for a Product (Admin).
- Stake $SWEAT to create a new Jar (User).
- Unstake (withdraw) $SWEAT from a Jar (User).
- Restake $SWEAT in a Jar once it's mature (User).
- Claim accrued $SWEAT from a Jar (User).
- Top up the $SWEAT balance of a Jar (User).

### 1.3. üßë‚Äçüíª Use cases

1. Admin can register a new Fixed Product. It must contain the Product ID, APY, Jar capacity, withdrawal fee, an optional verifying (public) key, lockup term, and indicators regarding whether it's enabled right after registration, allows top-ups, and allows restaking.
2. Admin can register a new Flexible Product. It must contain the Product ID, APY, Jar capacity, withdrawal fee, an optional verifying (public) key, and indicators regarding whether it's enabled right after registration.
3. Admin can enable or disable any registered Product. If a Product is disabled, a User cannot create new Jars for this Product. However, they can carry out top-ups and other operations with existing Jars.
4. Admin can set or change the verifying (public) key for a registered Product.
5. Admin can apply a penalty for any Premium Jar.
6. User can get details of a particular Jar.
7. User can get details of all Jars belonging to them.
8. User can get the total interest available to claim or interest for selected Jars.
9. User can get the total principal for all their Jars or principal for selected Jars.
10. User can get details of all Products registered in the contract.
11. User can stake $SWEAT and create a regular Jar for a chosen Product. To do that, the User must send $SWEAT to the Token Contract and attach a Ticket specifying a Product for which they want to stake.
12. User can stake $SWEAT and create a Premium Jar for a chosen Premium Product. To do that, the User must send $SWEAT to the Token Contract and attach a Ticket containing a Product for which they want to stake and the expiration date of this Ticket. The User also must attach a signature for this ticket obtained from an Oracle.
13. User can stake $SWEAT and create a Jar for another user. To do so, the User must specify the receiver's account ID in the message when they transfer $SWEAT to the Token Contract.
14. User can claim accrued $SWEAT from all their Jars or a specified set of Jars at any moment. To claim from a set of Jars, the User can either claim all available interest or set an amount they want to claim. If this amount is greater than the amount accrued at the moment, the maximum available amount is claimed.
15. User can withdraw the total principal of a Fixed Jar after its maturity. If a Product involves a withdrawal fee, the User pays this fee from the withdrawn principal amount.
16. User can withdraw any amount of $SWEAT from the principal of a Flexible Jar at any moment. If a Product involves a withdrawal fee, the User pays this fee from the withdrawn principal amount.
17. User can top up the principal of a Flexible Jar or Fixed Jar if the related Fixed Product allows top-ups.
18. User can restake a Fixed Jar after its maturity. On restake, a new Jar is created, and the principal of the original Jar is transferred to the new one.
