    /// This method receives a list of entities called `CeFiJar`, which represent token deposits
    /// from a 3rd party service, and creates corresponding `DeFi Jars` for them. In order to support
    /// the transition of deposit terms from the 3rd party to the contract, the `Product` with these
    /// terms must be registered beforehand.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// - `jars`: A vector of `CeFiJar` entities representing token deposits from a 3rd party service.
    /// - `total_received`: The total amount of tokens received, ensuring that all tokens are distributed
    ///   correctly.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// This method can panic in following cases:
    ///
    /// 1. If a `Product` required to create a Jar is not registered. In such a case, the migration
    ///    process cannot proceed, and the method will panic.
    ///
    /// 2. If the total amount of tokens received is not equal to the sum of all `CeFiJar` entities.
    ///    This panic ensures that all deposits are properly migrated, and any discrepancies will trigger
    ///    an error.
    ///
    /// 3. Panics in case of unauthorized access by non-admin users.
    ///
    /// # Authorization
    ///
    /// This method can only be called by the Contract Admin. Unauthorized access will result in a panic.
